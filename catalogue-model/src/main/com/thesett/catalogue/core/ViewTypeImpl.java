/**
 * ViewTypeImpl is the type of view components. A view component is a sub-set of the fields of a component, with
 * identical types of the fields in the subset to their corresponding types in a larger component. In this way a
 * component that 'conforms' to the view is a sub-type of it, and a restricted view of the component may be accessed
 * through a particular view. A view is analogous to an interface in Java.
