/**
 * A FactType is a {@link com.thesett.aima.state.Type} that is an {@link EntityType} that holds numerical values
 * at the intersection of many axes of investigation. A fact is an entity because it is persistently stored, but facts
 * are only ever stored in denormalized forms in data warehouses and not in online databases.
 *
 * <p/>Facts usually represent a single occurrence, or event, whereas an online database entity may represent an ongoing
 * situation. For example, if an entity is used to maintain the state of a customer order, through order assembly, quote,
 * purchase, dispatch, completion and so on, each of these individual states tracked by an entity may trigger an individual
 * fact to be inserted into a data warehouse, if the event is of statistical interest.
 *
 * <p/>The reason that facts usually only hold numerical values, is that facts are not intended to be consumed on an
 * individual basis. Facts exist at the intersection of many dimensions, which are used to group them together. For
 * example if a fact records the price of a purchase order, and a dimension links the purchase event to a customer
 * demographic, then the purchases may be queried by demographic groupings. Each query will return a set of facts which
 * need to be statistically summarized, and numerical data is the most amenable to providing averages, variances, max
 * and mins and other statistical results.
