/**
 * A DimensionType is a {@link com.thesett.aima.state.Type} that is an {@link EntityType} that, in addition to
 * the storage layout of an entity type, has a special denormalized storage layout of that sort that is used to build
 * 'star schemas' for data warehousing.
 *
 * <p/>A dimension is an 'axis of investigation' relating to a factual entry in a data warehouse. For example, if the
 * fact is a record of a completed purchase, a dimension may represent the time, date, place of purchase, item purchased,
 * customer demographic and so on relating to the purchase. Dimensions are used to query and group facts in order to
 * provide statistical answers to questions such as who?, when?, what?, where? and ultimately why? around the related
 * fact.
