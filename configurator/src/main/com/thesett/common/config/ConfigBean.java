/**
 * A ConfigBean is a bean (no arg constructor, get and set property fields) that is reponsible for configuring some
 * aspect of a system, often at start up time. They are beans so that they are easily set up by a configurator from
 * a properties or other config file. In addition they support a method to report that thay have carried out their
 * configuration duties succesfully and a method to trigger the configuration process that they represent. Config
 * beans must work in conjunction with a {@link Configurator}, and an instance of it is passed to the {@link #doConfigure}
 * method. The configurator provides methods for a config bean to query other config beans that it may depend upon.
 *
 * <p>The {@link #doConfigure} method takes a force parameter as an argument. If this is set to true then it
 * should force re-configuration to take place at run time. ConfigBeans should support runtime reconfiguration unless
 * it is impossible. Every effort should be made to support it because it extremely usefull to be able to reconfigure
 * a running system.

 * @todo A mechanism is to be added so that config beans can declare there dependencies. The configurator is then
 *       responsible for calling the config beans in the right order to allow depenedencies to be resolved.
