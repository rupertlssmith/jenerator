/**
 * ExternalId defines an id type that is safe to pass to exernal systems because they are guaranteed to have a very long
 * life span and to not change or get issued to different data items.
 *
 * <p/>Items in the catalogue can map to a URL (or other externally nameable resource). Internally, items may have
 * database keys but these can and will change as items are deleted, merged, relegated and as the structure of the
 * database evolves. The sequences used to generate these surrogate keys may also be unique only within a single data
 * type and not across all data types. The idea behind external identifiers is that they will be unique across all
 * externally referenceable data types and that once issued they will live forever and never be re-issued for a
 * different item of data. When items are deleted permanently from the catalogue their external identifiers must be kept
 * to ensure that they are never re-issued.
