/**
 * TransactionIndex is an extension of the {@link Index} interface to support transactional manipulation of indexes.
 * Transactional indexes support concurrent access to an index in such a way that changes made by simultaneous processes
 * appear atomically to each other and can isolate their visibility from each other. Other transactional properties,
 * such as saving the state permanently to disk, can also be supported.
 *
 * <p/>Transactional indexes support a transactional mode which is controlled by setting the desired transaction
 * isolation level. This is used where multiple processes are using the index simultanesouly and is particularly usefull
 * when used in conjunction with a database. It may be the case that records are stored in a database as well as cached
 * in an index for free text searching and in this case it is necessary to provide transactional support so that updates
 * can be made accross both the index and the database.

 *
 * @todo The transactional mode stuff needs a bit of a rethink. Can't do it quite so simply. Must support multiple
 *       transactions making changes at the same time. Need to keep track of which transaction has made which changes
 *       and only commit those relevant to the particular transaction that commits. Need to think also about the isolation
 *       level. I think implement the simplest level that will do (or maybe consider how different levels can be supported
 *       under different configurations and just implement the one that is needed for now, leaving the others for later
 *       completion). Consider: T1 begins, T2 begins and updates index and commits, T1 reads index, can it see T2's
 *       changes? If so reads are not repeatable. Can T1 see T2's changes before T2 commits? If so reads are dirty. If T2
 *       creates new items in the index will T1 see them? not repeatable. Before T2 commits? phantom reads. I think T1
 *       should not see T2's changes until T2 commits but that non-repeatable reads will be acceptable. After all once T2
 *       commits then the data should be there so any further attempts to access it should be ok (provided of course that
 *       its isolation level is read commited too, if its serializable it won't be visible yet). That is to say that, read
 *       committed level should suffice.  An implementation will need to create a seperate data structure to hold the
 *       workings of a transaction in and on commit to merge that into the committed index.
 *
 * @todo How do methods know which transaction is running? Is this obtained from the current thread, a transaction manager
 *       or is it passed explicitly? The workings of this need to be understood and adjustments made to the method
 *       signatures if needed. An implementation will need to create a seperate data structure to hold the workings of
 *       a transaction in and on commit to merge that into the committed index.
 *
 * @todo Rename this as Transactional and make TransactionlIndex an extension of it an Index. Transactional is a
 *       re-usable concept.
