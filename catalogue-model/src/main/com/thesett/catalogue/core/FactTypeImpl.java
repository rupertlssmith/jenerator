/**
 * FactTypeImpl is the type of a fact table in a data warehouse. A fact in an entity, as it is persisted to a database,
 * and generally speaking facts contain only numerical values or references to dimensions. In addition to numerical
 * values facts may sometimes contain discrete valued fields, for example enumerations. The more general rule is that
 * facts contain data elements that are amenable to aggregation and statistical analysis, at the intersection of
 * instances of one or more dimensions.
